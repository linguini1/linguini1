# Hey, what's up? âœŒðŸ˜¶

![Star Count][star-count]

I'm Matteo, and I'm a MASc student in Electrical and Computer engineering (with an aeronautics focus) at the University
of Waterloo in Canada. I hold a B.Eng in Computer systems from Carleton University, and I am an Apache NuttX committer.

I was a part of Carleton's rocketry design team, [CUInSpace][cuinspace], where I led a team of engineering students in
the development of a [real-time telemetry system using the Apache NuttX RTOS][nx-telem]. I also helped design [InSpace's
hybrid control system](https://github.com/CarletonURocketry/hysim) for remotely controlling the fill and ignition
operations of the team's first hybrid rocket (nitrous and paraffin wax propulsion system). Alongside the ground systems,
I designed the [critical flight system](https://github.com/CarletonURocketry/hybrid-valve-board) for keeping our ox tank
vent valve shut during flight. Both systems performed successfully at the team's first hybrid launch at [Launch Canada
2025](https://www.youtube.com/live/jSIWcusPTKk?si=B70fjPU5gJbYqTAo&t=29916)!

Now I build my own rockets and flight computer systems, my latest one being my L1 rocket
["Albie"](https://www.youtube.com/live/vYmQ0Gm4YIk?si=gbhsF1bJXzTjneUZ&t=34915) and its flight computer,
[Pygmy](https://github.com/linguini1/pygmy)!

If you haven't heard of NuttX, [check it out][nuttx]!

blog](https://linguini1.github.io/blog.html).
